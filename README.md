# Student Pair VI

## About The Program

This program will allow the entry of any number of students and will allow for placing the students randomly into groups of any specified size. Any "left over" students will be placed sequentially into pre existing groups. E.g. if eleven students populate the list and a group size of four is specified, you will get one group of six and a second group of five. Students can be added, removed, or groups randomly generated at any time.

This program will create a brand new comma separated value file, which will update as students are added and removed. The file, at this time, will not "persist" and therefore will no longer exist upon terminating the program. 

##Running The Program

Click on the fancy "Begin" button, and enter information into the fields. All fields remain optional, so the program will accept completely blank entries. The "Group Size" entry box does have validation checks, so the program will display some reminders if the "Group Size" entry box contains an invalid entry.
